#### grunt init:algorithm

Quickly scaffold an algorithm garden. It provides a Mocha test structure with expect style syntax from Chai. Quickly work on the algorithm itself, instead of tedious set up. Great for algorithm problems in general whether you are running through Project Euler or practicing for your big job interview. The algorithm scaffold is a great place to start.

1. `grunt init:algorithm`
2. `npm install`
3. Improve yourself.
